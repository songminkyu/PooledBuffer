PooledBufferManagement
A high-performance buffer management library leveraging ArrayPool to minimize memory fragmentation and improve application performance for network communications and data processing tasks.
Overview
This project demonstrates efficient memory management techniques for applications that handle large amounts of data or require frequent buffer allocations. By utilizing pooled memory resources through the ArrayPool mechanism, this library helps reduce garbage collection pressure and memory fragmentation, which is particularly beneficial for high-throughput applications.
Key Components
RentedBuffer<T>
A generic buffer implementation that acquires memory from an ArrayPool and automatically returns it when disposed. Key features include:

Memory pooling to minimize allocations and reduce GC pressure
Thread-safe operations for concurrent environments
Support for read and write operations with appropriate boundary checks
Optimized memory copying with parallel processing for large data sets
Efficient memory usage through centralized allocation and reclamation

ArrayPoolAllocator<T>
A static utility class that manages array pools for different buffer sizes:

Separate pools for small (â‰¤1024) and large (>1024) arrays
Shared empty array instance for zero-length requests
Automatic pool selection based on requested size
Memory clearing options for security-sensitive applications

Usage Scenarios
This library is particularly well-suited for:

Network Communication: Efficiently handle network packets and streams with minimal memory overhead
Large Data Processing: Process substantial datasets with reduced memory fragmentation
High-Throughput Applications: Maintain performance in scenarios with frequent buffer allocations and deallocations
Resource-Constrained Environments: Optimize memory usage in environments with limited resources

Example Usage
The provided sample code demonstrates several practical applications:

Basic Buffer Operations: Creating, writing to, reading from, and managing buffers
Network Communication: Implementing a TCP echo server and client using pooled buffers
Performance Comparison: Benchmarking standard allocation versus pooled buffers
Packet Processing: Processing structured network packets using efficient buffer management
Message Building: Constructing and streaming large messages with optimized memory usage

Performance Benefits
Performance tests demonstrate significant improvements when using pooled buffers:

Reduced allocation and deallocation overhead
Decreased memory fragmentation
Lower GC pressure and fewer collections
Improved throughput for high-volume operations

Getting Started

Add this library to your project
Replace standard array allocations with RentedBuffer<T> instances
Ensure proper disposal of buffers using using statements or explicit Dispose() calls
For advanced scenarios, utilize the specialized utility classes for packet processing and message building

Best Practices

Always dispose RentedBuffer<T> instances when done, preferably with using statements
Use appropriate buffer sizes to avoid unnecessary over-allocation
Consider thread safety requirements when sharing buffers across threads
For very large data sets, leverage the parallel processing capabilities of the library

Requirements

.NET 6.0 or later
System.Buffers package (for ArrayPool support)
